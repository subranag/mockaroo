## Starting Mockaroo
Starting mockaroo is simple download mockaroo binary for your target platform and drop it in you PATH if required, then simply start mockaroo by pointing it to you mock `hcl` file e.g.
```
mockaroo -conf ./<path_to_your_hcl_file>
```
the mock files are written in HCL https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/syntax/configuration.html , **HCL is a superb configuration language for clear configuration and readability**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE**: the file extension should be HCL otherwise you might get an error


## The Server Section 
the server section in the mock HCL deals with specifying HTTP(S) server related configuration, see sample file with documentation as well in HCL 
```hcl
server {
  /* 
    the server and port binding typically of the form
    localhost:<port> OR 127.0.0.1:<port> OR 0.0.0.0:<port> 
    you can also bind it to a specific ip and a port that is available 
  */   
  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

  /* 
    since this will be running locally snake oil is used in the name 
    NOTHING is stopping you from using real cert and key
  */
  // e.g. "/home/subbu/snake_oil_cert/server.crt"
  snake_oil_cert = "/<path>/<cert_file_name>.crt"

  // e.g. "/home/subbu/snake_oil_cert/server.key" 
  snake_oil_key  = "/<path>/<key_file_name>.key" 

  /* 
    you can also provide a request_log_path where requests will be logged
    this is OPTIONAL, but recommended to see what kind of requests are coming 
    along
  */
  request_log_path = "/var/tmp/requests.log"
  ...
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE**: the server will start in HTTPS mode if and only if BOTH snake_oil_cert and snake_oil_key are present

## The Mock Blocks
after the server section is declared in the HCL file you need declare *one or more* mock blocks in the mockaroo file 

there can be several mock blocks, typically you can declare all the mocks required for a single use-case or scenario in a single mock HCL file, see example below where two mocks are declared 

```hcl
server {

  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

  // you can declare several mock sections and give each mock a meaningful name
  mock "get_user" {
    request {
      path = "/user/{userId}"
      verb = "GET"
    }
    response {
      body = <<EOF
            user id from GET {{.PathVariable "userId"}}
            EOF
    }
  }

  // another mock with the same HTTP path but different verb "POST"
  mock "post_user" {
    request {
      path = "/user/{userId}"
      verb = "POST"
    }
    response {
      # NOTE: response status is 201 created
      status = 201

      body = <<EOF
            user id from POST {{.PathVariable "userId"}}
            EOF
    }
  }
}
```
> üö® **NOTE**: there is order to matching mocks , mocks should be declared in decreasing order of *specificity in matching* from the *MOST SPECIFIC MATCH* to *LEAST SPECIFIC MATCH* otherwise matching may not work as expected

## Matching Query Params
you can specify query parameters to match query params on incoming request, please look at the example below to see how to do it, you can match query params to value 

```hcl
server {

  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

  mock "get_beer_lager" {
    request {
      path = "/beer"
      verb = "GET"

      // you can match criteria on query params 
      // you can specify multiple query params
      /*
      queries = {
        a = "b"
        c = "b" 
        ...
      }
      */
      queries = {
        type = "lager"
      }
    }
    response {
      body = <<EOF
            my beer is {{.Form.Get "type"}}, brand is {{.Fake.BeerMalt}}
            EOF
    }
  }

  mock "get_beer_ipa" {
    request {
      path = "/beer"
      verb = "GET"

      // here we match ipa
      queries = {
        type = "ipa"
      }
    }
    response {

      body = <<EOF
            my beer is {{.Form.Get "type"}}, brand is {{.Fake.BeerHop}}
            EOF
    }
  }
}
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE**: currently regex matching is not available for query params but will be added in the future

## Matching Headers
the headers in the HTTP request can be matched as well, take a look at the example below to see how header matching works, documentation is in the mock itself

```hcl
server {

  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

    mock "get_patient" {
    request {
      path = "/patient/{patientId}"
      verb = "GET"

      // you can match headers as regex as well as plain string 
      // all GET requests that come in with Origin "Clinic .*" will
      // match this request
      // you can specify several headers as well
      headers = {
        "Origin" = "Clinic .*"
      }
    }
    response {
      // you can specify headers for response as well you can specify 
      // any number of headers  
      headers = {
        Content-Type = "application/json"
      }

      body = <<EOF
{
    "patient_id": "{{.PathVariable "patientId"}}",
    "patient_name": "{{.Fake.Name}}",
    "email": "{{.Fake.Email}}",
    "street": "{{.Fake.Street}}",
    "state": "{{.Fake.State}}",
    "ssn": "{{.Fake.SSN}}",
    "phone": "{{.Fake.PhoneFormatted}}",
    "source": "Clinic/{{.Headers.Get "Origin"}}"
}
            EOF
    }
  }

  mock "get_patient_hospital" {
    request {
      path = "/patient/{patientId}"
      verb = "GET"

      // you can match headers as regex as well as plain string 
      // all GET requests that come in with Origin "Clinic .*" will
      // match this request
      // you can specify several headers as well
      headers = {
        "Origin" = "Hospital .*"
      }
    }
    response {
      // you can specify headers for response as well you can specify 
      // any number of headers  
      headers = {
        Content-Type = "application/json"
      }

      body = <<EOF
{
    "patient_id": "{{.PathVariable "patientId"}}",
    "patient_name": "{{.Fake.Name}}",
    "email": "{{.Fake.Email}}",
    "street": "{{.Fake.Street}}",
    "state": "{{.Fake.State}}",
    "ssn": "{{.Fake.SSN}}",
    "phone": "{{.Fake.PhoneFormatted}}",
    "source": "Hospital/{{.Headers.Get "Origin"}}"
}
            EOF
    }
  }
}
```

## Accessing Request Body
if the RAW quest body can be parsed as JSON the entire parsed JSON is available to the template context when sending back response let us look at example below

```hcl
server {

  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

  mock "request_body_in_template" {
    request {
      path = "/request/body"
      verb = "POST"
    }

    response {
      // if the request body can be parsed as JSON the entire request is available 
      // as dictionary an array references you can access them in templates using 
      // the GOLANG template index function see example below
      body = <<EOF
id is {{index .JsonBody "id"}}
array values are {{index .JsonBody "value" 0}} {{index .JsonBody "value" 1}} {{index .JsonBody "value" 2}}
            EOF
    }
  }

}
```

After starting the server with the above configuration you can verify the output using cURL commands shown below
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'{"id":"a", "value":[1, 2, 3]}' "http://localhost:5000/request/body"
```
expected output should be 
```
id is a
array values are 1 2 3
```
you can write some very powerful mocks having the entire request JSON in the template context
