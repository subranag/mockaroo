# Mock-a-(roo)ü¶ò Docs
This page contains detailed documentation on how to use mockaroo to create complex HTTP(S) mocking solutions, click on each section to see how to proceed

## Starting Mockaroo
Starting mockaroo is simple download mockaroo binary for your target platform and drop it in you PATH if required, then simply start mockaroo by pointing it to you mock `hcl` file e.g.
```
mockaroo -conf ./<path_to_your_hcl_file>
```
the mock files are written in HCL https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/syntax/configuration.html , **HCL is a superb configuration language for clear configuration and readability**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE**: the file extension should be HCL otherwise you might get an error


## The server section 
the server section in the mock HCL deals with specifying HTTP(S) server related configuration, see sample file with documentation as well in HCL 
```hcl
server {
  /* 
    the server and port binding typically of the form
    localhost:<port>127.0.0.1:<port>/0.0.0.0:<port> 
    you can also bind it to a specific ip and a port that is available 
  */   
  listen_addr = "localhost:5000"

  /* 
    since this will be running locally snake oil is used in the name 
    NOTHING is stopping you from using real cert and key
  */
  // e.g. "/home/subbu/snake_oil_cert/server.crt"
  snake_oil_cert = "/<path>/<cert_file_name>.crt"

  // e.g. "/home/subbu/snake_oil_cert/server.key" 
  snake_oil_key  = "/<path>/<key_file_name>.key" 

  /* 
    you can also provide a request_log_path where requests will be logged
    this is OPTIONAL, but recommended to see what kind of requests are coming 
    along
  */
  request_log_path = "/var/tmp/requests.log"
  ...
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è**NOTE**: BOTH snake_oil_cert and snake_oil_key should be present to start the server in HTTPS mode
